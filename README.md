# Image_Classification_Using_CNN
find out some work sample in pynb file


This is the first model i did on Convolutional neural network.
The data set was taken from keras CIFAR library .
It contains 60000 of images from 10 categories and eaching having a size 32*32

>Goal is to find the label correctly when a new input provide to the model.
>This model is a small introduction to CNN, the performance can also be increased by performing Hyperparameter tuning using Keras tuner.
